                <h1>Travelling in Tagawa</h1>
                <h2>Photography Exhibition by Anne Virta</h2>
                <p><b>Tagawa (Tagawa-shi)</b> city located in Fukuoka Prefecture in Kyushu Island, Japan. Tagawa is
                    surrounded by mountains,
                    Mount Hiko in the south. <b>Hikosan Shrine,</b> Fukuoka’s only Jingu shrine, the most prestigious
                    Shinto
                    shrine, nestled on sacred mountain Mount Hiko.
                    Since ancient times people have visited the shrine to worship the god of safety in farming and
                    mining.
                </p>
                <p>In year 2009 <b>“Peeks into the Dancing Moominvalley”</b> (<a
                        href="http://dancingmoominvalley.blogspot.com/2009/11/kurkistuksia-tanssivaan-muumilaaksoon.html"
                        target="_blank">link</a> to the Dancing Moominvalley blog) took part to a happening introducing
                    Tove Jansson´s work and Finland in <b>Fukuoka Asian Art Museum</b>. I was photographing the working
                    process and
                    the show for children in Fukuoka Asian Art Museum.</p>
                <p>I travelled with the dancers, and the producer and the composer of the music of the Dancing
                    Moominvalley.
                    We had an honour to stay in
                    a Japanese family in Tagawa. It was awesome since to travelling to Japan has been my dream since I
                    was
                    twelve!
                    So we climbed up the stairs to the Shinto Shrine in the holy Mount Hiko and I was touched by the the
                    forest and the mountain with
                    magnificent scenes and its ancient places and builings.</p>
